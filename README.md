# Finite-Difference-Method-Perturbation-Theory-Study
This project implements the Finite Difference Method in order to solve the time-independant Schrodinger equation for both the Double Well and Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Potentials. First-Order Perterbation theory is also applied to the QHO, to analyse the affect of a Quartic Perturbation on two different Eigenstates
